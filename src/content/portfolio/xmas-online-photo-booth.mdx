Invited by a flagship shopping mall in Hong Kong, I developed an online photo booth as a part of the mall's Xmas promotion campaign. The project enabled the client to reach over thousands of customers and retain the customer relationship during the pandemic.

Users can choose a site photo among 12 photo hotspots of the mall as the background and paste a portrait photo of themselves. After that, they can share the synthesised photo to their relatives and friends to spread the seasonal joyfulness.

# Challenges
The feeling of Christmas atmosphere is the core goal of the project. Our team hoped the platform could reach as many people as possible. Therefore, making it compatible with various devices was the biggest challenge. Traditionally, real-time background removal requires a green screen background or a depth camera. These methods are not a well-fitted for home-use application, especially a web-based platform.

Another challenge was the short development time under the pandemic. I had less than a month to complete the system design and development.

# Solution

I developed this web-based photo booth platform with Vue.js and Canvas. Users could choose a background and upload their own photos. Then, the platform would automatically separate the persons from photos.

Thanks to the power of Machine Learning, I adopted TensorFlow Lite to execute [body segmentation](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/01/body-segmentation.html) on a web-based platform. This method requires no extra equipment, which makes the whole process simple and intuitive. In addition, the result is fast and accurate.

I made use of a few simple Firebase Functions to handle actions like photo upload and sharing, and used Firebase Storage to store the greeting cards created by users. This serverless approach enabled me to develop and deploy the project rapidly in a low cost.

# Result
The project achieved a great success to engage with its target customers and was reported by the local media and press. The platform was developed to get compatible with mainstream mobile devices, and optimized the page structure to achieve a fast loading speed.
