---introduction
---
A medium-sized delivery company processed over 200K delivery orders in a month. I designed and developed its order tracking system for customers to trace orders, plus a customer loyalty system and payment gateways integration.

With a cloud-native architecture comprised of several serverless components, the system was designed to be scalable and could handle a large volume of transactions with a 70% reduction in infrastructure cost.
